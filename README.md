# Phantom QA MCP Server

This repository contains MCP server that will host Browser Use Agent as tool and access to different API services from other solution [Phantom QA Agentic Workflow](https://github.com/anupmanekar/phantom-qa-agentic-workflow). The APIs call into services in [Phantom RAG Platform](https://github.com/anupmanekar/phantom-rag-platform)

So this is kind of bridge between Agentic solution and APIs or other tools like BrowserUse

# Usage
